## Overview

This directory contains the agent prompt specifications used in the BMAD (Business-Manager-Architect-Developer) agentic development method. Each agent is a specialized Claude Code persona that produces specific artifacts consumed by downstream agents.

### How to Use with Claude Code

Each agent file below can be used as a Claude Code task prompt. The recommended workflow:

1. Start a Claude Code session
2. Load the agent prompt as context: `claude "$(cat agents/ba-agent.md)"`
3. Provide the input artifacts referenced in the agent spec
4. Review the output, iterate, then commit to the repo
5. Move to the next agent in the chain

Alternatively, chain them in a single session by feeding outputs as inputs to the next agent.
